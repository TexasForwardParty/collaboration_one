This is a space to test out a prototype of our accessible policy development process. 

Please follow these rules: 

1) You must link to free, clean URLs. For example:

Correct: https://archive.ph/qEbPr

If you do not know how to do this, refer to further training documentation in the repository.  

2) You must write comments in the following way: 
- No logical fallacies (https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/)
- Provide sources that explain any phrases, references, or science supporting your position. 
- Provide statistics wherever possible and link to the source of said statistic.
- When you have a disagreement with something that is written, please follow the NG Protocol, as described below. 

## Neutral Ground Protocol:
The Neutral Ground protocol creates a safe space for discussion, creating structured, respectful engagement. It follows a general formula of "When (event) happens, we are (impacted in this way), and we need (boundaries, requirements) 


Avoid blame-based framing: 
Instead of: "When farmers pollute our water..."
Use: "When agricultural runoff enters waterways..."

Focus on systemic issues, not individual actors: 
Instead of: "When the town council ignores our concerns..."
Use: "When community input isn't integrated into policy decisions..."

Make specific policy requests: 
Instead of: "We need farmers to be more responsible"
Use: "We need mandatory buffer zones of 100 feet from water sources"
