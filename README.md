This is a space to test out a prototype of our accessible policy development process. 

Please follow these rules: 

1) You must link to free, clean URLs. For example: 
WRONG: https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/investment-portfolios-politics-6d186f91?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAiSN-VVUBLqzcgEOEHAP1PESlBRJjGXltrScjC1Ox0i4azNjKCpWFpWSDji8D8%3D&gaa_ts=6858187b&gaa_sig=wAdk2ddNIVian80YS07qOAvpHwHCNAA1jgyEOnhIqRleHTBeG0QZHEnHmCISx2cC-FSfYcYkXuogPVdIItoo2w%3D%3D

Correct: https://archive.ph/qEbPr

If you do not know how to do this, refer to further training documentation in the repository.  

2) You must write comments in the following way: 
- No logical fallacies (https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/)
- Provide sources that explain any phrases, references, or science supporting your position. 
- Provide statistics wherever possible and link to the source of said statistic.
- When you have a disagreement with something that is written, please follow the NG Protocol, as described below. 

## Neutral Ground Protocol:
Avoid blame-based framing: 
Instead of: "When farmers pollute our water..."
Use: "When agricultural runoff enters waterways..."

Focus on systemic issues, not individual actors: 
Instead of: "When the town council ignores our concerns..."
Use: "When community input isn't integrated into policy decisions..."

Make specific policy requests: 
Instead of: "We need farmers to be more responsible"
Use: "We need mandatory buffer zones of 100 feet from water sources"
